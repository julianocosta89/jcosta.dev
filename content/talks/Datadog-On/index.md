{{< youtube M35d-sdqtuU >}}

OpenTelemetry (OTel) is an open source, vendor-neutral observability framework that supplies APIs, SDKs,
and tools to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces and
soon profiles). It has a vibrant ecosystem of components, integrations and vendors.

In this episode, Juliano Costa will discuss OpenTelemetry with
[Felix Geisendörfer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felixg2/), Senior Staff Engineer
on the Continuous Profiling team, and [Pablo Baeyens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablo-baeyens/),
Senior Software Engineer on the OpenTelemetry team.

They will explore the current state of the profiling signal within OpenTelemetry and the progress made so
far. The conversation will also cover the road to the OTel Collector 1.0 release and why this milestone
is crucial for the broader community. Additionally, they will dig into the challenges of OpenTelemetry
at Datadog from an engineering perspective and discuss what the future holds for this integration.

By the end of the episode, you'll gain a deeper understanding of OpenTelemetry and how the Datadog team
is contributing to its growth. You’ll also hear about the current challenges facing the team and what’s
on the horizon.
