Kubernetes Certifications? Why should I watch this talk?

The internet is full of blog posts and videos about Kubernetes certifications, yet Juliano
and Yuri would like to share with you some hands-on tips and tricks to succeed in the
Kubernetes certifications available at the moment (CKA, CKAD) and what to expect of
the new CKS (expected to be released in November 2020). They would also like to share
(with surprises) the methods used during the preparation.
